# Westlaw: The Future of Legal Research, and Maybe (Junior) Lawyers?
### Law may be famously slow to adapt to new technology, but Westlaw never has been.  In the Age of AI, is the future of legal research simply to replace entry-level associates?

## Institutional Westlaw <a name="introduction"></a>
Most everyone is familiar with the Hollywood romantacized image on the underdog attorney doing research.  Locked in the dusty law library stacks over weekends and late into the night, he diligently reads case after case, dutifully searching for the precident that will free his innocent(?) client.

##### <i>Jimmy Stewart hitting the stacks in "Anatomy of a Murder".</i>

To the extent this image ever real, technnology began to slit its throat [as early as 1974](https://riesenfeldcenter.blogspot.com/2023/03/west-publishing-and-history-of-westlaw.htm) when West Publishing, a publisher of case law digests and other legal publishing since 1872, developed a computer system to search case headnotes across its publications. The product entered the market in 1975, and eventually became known as Westlaw: the now ubiqutious legal research tool that took lawyers out of the stacks, and anchored them to their desktops. Out were flipping pages, and in was keyword searches by hordes of young associates, billed to clients at many hundreds of dollars-per-hour. Now owned by Thomson Reuters, Westlaw controls [over 35%](https://6sense.com/tech/legal-research/westlaw-vs-lexisadvance) of the $406.1 million (as of 2019) [legal research market](https://growthmarketreports.com/report/legal-research-software-market-global-industry-analysis).

The legal professional itself is famously clumsy adapting to technology innovations.  For instance, Maryland courts in 2007 created a rule that established higher bars for [authenticating social media posts](https://www.naag.org/attorney-general-journal/status-update-on-authenticating-social-media-evidence-the-three-primary-approaches-applied-nationally/) than other types of evidence.  This just as the world--and evidence--was moving more and more into the virtual world of Facebook and Twitter.

Yet Westlaw was a product born from the early adoption of a new technology, and its success was largely the result of that first-mover advantage. The question is, can it do it again in the age of AI?

Westlaw certainly believes it can.  Long before the AI dam broke, Thomson Reuters as early as 2018 was trying to incorporate AI into its products, starting with [Westlaw Edge](https://www.techlawcrossroads.com/2018/07/westlaw-edge-ai-goes-mainstream/).  In many ways, Westlaw Edge's original focus on data analytics, searching for things like how often a judge grants or denies certain types of motions, anticipated the predictive power of AI that only now is receiving mainstream attention.  

In late 2023, Thomson Reuters announced several new and upcoming AI products under the [Westlaw banner](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thomson-reuters-launches-generative-ai-powered-solutions-to-transform-how-legal-professionals-work-301989149.html):

>- AI-Assisted Research on <b>Westlaw Precision</b> – Better, faster answers to complex research questions drawn from the industry's most comprehensive collection of editorially enhanced content  
>- A new **GenAI assistant** connects all Thomson Reuters generative AI products, building on innovation from Casetext 
>- <b>Thomson Reuters Generative AI Platform</b> – A common development platform to design, build, and deploy GenAI skills with unparalleled speed  
>- <b>New GenAI capabilities for Practical Law</b> – Customers to benefit from AI chat-type interface 
>- <b>CoCounsel Core</b> – Announcing the commercial offering of CoCounsel skills as part of the Thomson Reuters portfolio 

The press release is rich in corporate buzzwords, as if written by a chatbot to jump on the late-2023 OpenAI excitement that was then everywhere in the news.  But this is a company which been active in this space for at least six years, meaning that this announcement is far from an exercise in jumping on the proverbial bnandwagon.  The first two bulletpoints speak to improvements to Westlaw's current research functionality.  But the last three bulletpoints are the most important, and give the game away: <i>Westlaw is functionally getting into the AI lawyer business.</i>

##### <i>Who else does nothing but review documents and write memos the first two-to-five years of their career?  New law grads in big firms, mostly.</i>

A November 2023 <i>Above the Law</i> [post discussing Westlaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/westlaw-ai-launch-forces-confrontation-with-the-inner-workings-of-a-lawyers-mind/) made the case for its upcoming AI products more bluntly than any marketing company dare would:

>The proper comparison is to the 2 hours a junior associate would bill [compared to 2-4 minutes for Westlaw's AI] for taking all that research and pumping out a two-page memo.

What about the quality of advice?  From the same post:

>But an anonymous Thomson Reuters in-house customer said after seeing these new [AI] capabilities: “This is substantially the same advice I just paid to get from outside counsel and was billed about 15 hours.”

A bad sign for anyone taking out law school loans that this early into the AI revolution, junior associates are already being outpaced by what was just their predecessors' case law search engine up until last year.

## Legal Economics <a name="paragraph2"></a>

To be clear, the issue is not Westlaw marketing AI lawyers per se.  With [175 members of Congress](https://www.americanbar.org/advocacy/governmental_legislative_work/publications/washingtonletter/january-2021-wl/attorneys-117thcongress/) having law degrees as of 2021, a well-oiled lobbying machine (many lobbying firms are [also law firms](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/top-lobbying-firms), after all), and a Bar exam system which allows the legal guild to determine who (or, perhaps in the future, what) can practice law, in at least the short-term there will not be chatbots arguing in court.

But they don't need to offer a fully-automated.  Labor is a cost in any industry, and however much law flatters itself as being something special--a profession, ethical standards, etc.--in the end it's still a business.  A business which, aside from keyword searches in PDFs and Westlaw case law research, has had precious few opportunities to automate.  An AI that knows every case in every jurisdiction and can put together a good-enough memo in a few minutes is to the junior law firm associate what the Chicxulub meterior was to the dinosaurs.  

Corporate law firms had revenues of [$160.4 billion](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/market-size/corporate-law-firms-united-states/) in 2023.  Westlaw, through its AI product (which will no doubt improve) is offering a way for these firms to keep a higher percentage of those revenues.  Between this cost-savings (and perhaps additional savings as, unlike employee lawyers, an AI won't sue you) and the dreams of a recent law grad hoping to make big bucks, the choice is easy: Westlaw all the way.
