# Westlaw: The Future of Legal Research, and Maybe (Junior) Lawyers?
### Law may be famously slow to adapt to new technology, but Westlaw never has been.  In the Age of AI, is the future of legal research simply to replace entry-level associates?

## Institutional Westlaw <a name="introduction"></a>
Most everyone is familiar with the Hollywood romantacized image on the underdog attorney doing research.  Locked in the dusty law library stacks over weekends and late into the night, he diligently reads case after case, dutifully searching for the precident that will free his innocent(?) client.

##### <i>Jimmy Stewart hitting the stacks in "Anatomy of a Murder".</i>

To the extent this image ever real, technnology began to slit its throat as early as 1974 when West Publishing, a publisher of case law digests and other legal publishing since 1872, developed a computer system to search case headnotes across its publications. The product entered the market in 1975, and eventually became known as Westlaw: the now ubiqutious legal research tool that took lawyers out of the stacks, and anchored them to their desktops. Out were flipping pages, and in was keyword searches by hordes of young associates, billed to clients at many hundreds of dollars-per-hour. Now owned by Thomson Reuters, Westlaw controls over 35% of the $406.1 million (as of 2019) legal research market.

The legal professional itself is famously clumsy adapting to technology innovations.  (For instance, Maryland courts in 2017 created a rule that established higher bars for authenticating social media posts than other types of evidence.  This just as the world--and evidence--was moving more and more into the virtual world of Facebook and Twitter.) Yet Westlaw was a product born from the early adoption of a new technology, and its success was largely the result of that first-mover advantage. 

The question is, can it do it again in the age of AI?

Westlaw certainly believes it can.  Long before the AI dam broke, Thomson Reuters as early as 2018 was trying to incorporate AI into its products, starting with [Westlaw Edge](https://www.techlawcrossroads.com/2018/07/westlaw-edge-ai-goes-mainstream/).  In many ways, Westlaw Edge's original focus on data analytics, searching for things like how often a judge grants or denies certain types of motions, anticipated the predictive power of AI that only now is receiving mainstream attention.  

In late 2023, Thomson Reuters announced several new and upcoming AI products under the [Westlaw banner](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thomson-reuters-launches-generative-ai-powered-solutions-to-transform-how-legal-professionals-work-301989149.html):

>- AI-Assisted Research on <b>Westlaw Precision</b> – Better, faster answers to complex research questions drawn from the industry's most comprehensive collection of editorially enhanced content  
>- A new **GenAI assistant** connects all Thomson Reuters generative AI products, building on innovation from Casetext 
>- <b>Thomson Reuters Generative AI Platform</b> – A common development platform to design, build, and deploy GenAI skills with unparalleled speed  
>- <b>New GenAI capabilities for Practical Law</b> – Customers to benefit from AI chat-type interface 
>- <b>CoCounsel Core</b> – Announcing the commercial offering of CoCounsel skills as part of the Thomson Reuters portfolio 

The press release is rich in corporate buzzwords, as if written by a chatbot to jump on the late-2023 OpenAI excitement that was then everywhere in the news.  But this is a company which been active in this space for at least six years, meaning that this announcement is far from an exercise in jumping on the proverbial bnandwagon.  The first two bulletpoints speak to improvements to Westlaw's current research functionality.  But the last three bulletpoints are the most important, and give the game away: <i>Westlaw is functionally getting into the AI lawyer business.</i>

##### <i>Who else does nothing but review documents and write memos the first two-to-five years of their career?  New law grads in big firms, mostly.</i>

A November 2023 <i>Above the Law</i> [post discussing Westlaw](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/11/westlaw-ai-launch-forces-confrontation-with-the-inner-workings-of-a-lawyers-mind/) made the case for its upcoming AI products more bluntly than any marketing company dare would:

>The proper comparison is to the 2 hours a junior associate would bill [compared to 2-4 minutes for Westlaw's AI] for taking all that research and pumping out a two-page memo.

What about the quality of advice?  From the same post:

>But an anonymous Thomson Reuters in-house customer said after seeing these new capabilities: “This is substantially the same advice I just paid to get from outside counsel and was billed about 15 hours.”

A bad sign for anyone taking out law school loans that this early into the AI revolution, junior associates are already being outpaced by what was just their predecessors' search engine up until last year.

But why woo

While politically connected partners are safe, 





in 2017, and even then states remained divided between the Texas and Maryland approaches to the technology).

West Publishing developed a computer system to search case headnotes across its reporters, entering the market with its technology in 1975. The product, familiar everywhere today as Westlaw, marked the beginning of one of the most successful commercial legal tools developed. In 1978, locked in competition with Mead Data Corp., Westlaw began to provide full-text search for cases. In 1979, dial-up access to the database was offered over phone lines to its customers. By the early to mid-1980s, Westlaw terminals and the services it offered were becoming increasingly indispensable to American legal consumers.

for good in the '90s when improved
